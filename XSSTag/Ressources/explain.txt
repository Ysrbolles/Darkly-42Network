on the home page we can see that just one image is clickable 
it's redirect us to:
http://{IP}/?page=media&src=nsa

after inspecting the HTML page we find the image displayed by <Object>  instead of <img>
ANd the data of the Object tag chosen by the src variable in the url : http://{IP}/?page=media&src=nsa
<object data="http://{IP}/images/nsa_prism.jpg"></object>
