LOCAL FILE INCLUSION

In the browser address bar, enter the following:

?page=../../../../../../etc/passwd
The ‘../’ characters used in the example above represent a directory traversal. The number of ‘../’ sequences depends on the configuration and location of the target web server on the victim machine. Some experimentation may be required.

We can see that the contents of /etc/passwd are displayed on the screen. A lot of useful information about the host can be obtained this way

how to secure: 
    -Use a whitelist of filenames and ignore every other filename and path.
    -Save the file paths in a database and assign an ID to each of them. By doing so, users only see the ID and are not able to view or change the path.
    -Instead of including files on the web server, store their content in databases where possible.
