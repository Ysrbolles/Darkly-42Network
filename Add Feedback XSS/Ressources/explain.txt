we thought we had to submit the form with the Name field
Inspecting the source code we see 2 interesing facts :
 1) the forms calls the validate_form() js at submission checking that the fields are note empty
    (<form method="post" name="guestform" onsubmit="return validate_form(this)">)
 2) The form button calls the checkForm() function on click (<td><input name="btnSign" type="Submit" value="Sign Guestbook" onClick="return checkForm();"></td>)

 The onClick button is triggered before the submission event of the form.
 To observe this behavior we submit it.
 On the console we see an error message concerning checkForm(). It doesn't exist.
 It would be good to implement it and change the form behavior.
 Still in the consolle we implement the function this way :
	function checkForm()
	{
		document.guestform.setAttribute("onsubmit", "return true");
	}
This snippet of code can change the "onsubmit" attribut of the form's name element in order to submit the form
without any check on client side. But it doesn't work

Now we can try a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
We put a simple script in the message part and validate. We got the flag.

Also we have another way to get the flag, is to just enter "script" in name or message input

How to secure :
 - Sanitize and check inputs, also you can encode the input
