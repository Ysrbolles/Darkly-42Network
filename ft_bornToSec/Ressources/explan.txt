by clicking on the copyrigth sign we got a page with this url: 
http://${IP}/?page=e43ad1fdc54babe674da7c7b8f0127bde61de3fbe01def7d00f151c2fcca6d1c

after we Inspecting the HTML Page we found two critical information in the comment: 

<!--

<!--
Let's use this browser : "ft_bornToSec". It will help you a lot.
-->

we need to change the header of the http request: the refrer and the user-agent 

to do this we can use curl cmd: 
curl -A 'ft_bornToSec' -e "https://www.nsa.gov/" "http://${IP}/?page=e43ad1fdc54babe674da7c7b8f0127bde61de3fbe01def7d00f151c2fcca6d1c" > resp.html

we found the flag in resp.html file

how to secure:
    - Check the request headers in the server side
