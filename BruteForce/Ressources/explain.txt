We did not find a sql injection possibility on the page http://{IP}/?page=signin

that's why we try to bruteforce the signin page.

we a brutforce script : bruteForce.sh that take a list of must used password.
we can found lists of password used in: https://wiki.skullsecurity.org/Passwords.

How to secure:
    - implement limitation on the number of request possible by an ip and block it
